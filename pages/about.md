## About the Collection

This site is intended to act as a digital collection of our family photos for those who have not been able to access to physical pictures. When Grandma Jan and Grandpa Bill moved out of their home in 2019, they left hundreds, if not *thousands* of photos, heirlooms, and memorabilia behind. There are some albums that were saved for decades of weddings, birthdays, and other events that we didn't know existed! From Grandma Jan's kindergarten report cards to their original wedding album to cards from every possible relative, there are many more items that could end up in this collection. Unfortunately, many of the folders and bins containing the pictures are either unorganized, missing context, or both.

While this project began as a part of August's LBSC671 course in grad school, it is hoped to become much more- there are many more photos stored away in bins to be scanned, organized, and uploaded here. A digital collection of Grandpa Bill's paintings is in the works to preserve decades of art that has been carried miles away from the little shed in the backyard of our grandparents' house.

If you would like your photos to be added to this collection, if you have context or background on some of the 'unknowns' in the collection, or if you have other questions or concerns, please email August at ap98@umd.edu. Privacy of the individuals pictured and consent for uploading is extremely important, and your full permission is required for uploading. 

In loving memory of Janice Zeiger McGrath, 1932 - 2022
